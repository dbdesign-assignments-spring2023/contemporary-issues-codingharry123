# Global warming
In this document, I discuss two articles about tendency of global warming and an estimation of change in temperature due to human activities and other important factors on a global scale. I present and discuss two competing views on this important issue that influences everyone.

## Article 1

In United States Environmental Protection Agency's [Future of Climate Change](https://climatechange.chicago.gov/climate-change-science/future-climate-change), future temperatures are expected to change further. Climate models project the following key temperature-related changes so that
increases in average global temperatures are expected to be within the range of 0.5°F to 8.6°F by 2100, with a likely increase of at least 2.7°F for all scenarios except the one representing the most aggressive mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Except under the most aggressive mitigation scenario studied, global average temperature is expected to warm at least twice as much in the next 100 years as it has during the last 100 years. It seems that there is still hope even though global warming seems to be accelerating overall.

There can be discrepancies in the effect of global warming over different regions.Ground-level air temperatures are expected to continue to warm more rapidly over land than oceans, and some parts of the world are projected to see larger temperature increases than the global average.

## Article 2

Contrary to the claims made in the above piece on the issue, Madeleine Stone's [Predictions of Future Global Climate](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/5-possible-climate-futures-from-the-optimistic-to-the-strange) is more optimistic. He argues that future isn’t set in stone despite the UN’s latest report on the state of the climate apocalyptic natural disasters. Depending on global economic trends, technological progress, geopolitical developments, and most important, how aggressively we act to reduce carbon emissions, the world at the end of the 21st century could make a difference.

Hausfather notes that nations representing approximately two-thirds of global emissions have now committed to zeroing out their emissions by the middle of the century. If these countries are able to make good on their pledges, and if other developing nations follow suit—big ifs, of course—“it does put warming outcomes between 1.5 and 2 very much on the table.”
